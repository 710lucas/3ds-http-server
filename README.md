# 3ds http server

This is a simple server that you can run in your 3ds

I'll try to turn this into a library so you can use it the way that you want to

is still in development, but if you want you can compile this and run the template in your 3ds

## Features

For now, we have the following features:

- http get protocol

- http post protocol

- a body parser

## known bugs

- You can basically replace the http_server.3dsx with the upload_page

- you can also add files outside of the /website folder

## Things to do

- URGENT: make the code for the get-pages and upload_page readable (that shit is awful, and also find out a consitent way of naming important website files)

- adding a password to the get-pages and upload_page pages (i need to find a way of naming things omg)

- adding redirect response or whatever this thing is called

- oh yeah, i need to make a tutorial also (and i need to remember to update this shit)

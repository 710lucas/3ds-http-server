# 3ds http server

This is a simple server that you can run in your 3ds

I'll try to turn this into a library so you can use it the way that you want to

is still in development, but if you want you can compile this and run the template in your 3ds

## Features

For now, we have the following features:

- http get protocol

- http post protocol

- a body parser

## known bugs

- You can basically replace the http_server.3dsx with the upload_page

- you can also add files outside of the /website folder

## Things to do

- improve password thing

- adding redirect response or whatever this thing is called (added only 302, it still needs more redirect things idk)

- oh yeah, i need to make a tutorial also (and i need to remember to update this shit)

- cookies
